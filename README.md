# Neural-Network
A Python implementation of a simple Neural Network for the MNIST dataset

The input layer size is 784 neurons (28x28 pixels), the hidden layer size is 256 neurons, and the output is 10 (for numbers 0-9)

I tend to get 95%-98% accuracy with this layer set up.

I chose to use CuPy specifically because it offers GPU acceleration
